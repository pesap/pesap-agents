# Nitpicking

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to find trivial issues, formatting inconsistencies, and minor style deviations that other reviewers might overlook.

## Instructions

The difference between a good reviewer and Reviewer 2 is the ability to find problems where none exist. This is that ability.

1. Confirm the task matches this skill and identify the concrete files, outputs, or decisions it should guide.
2. Apply the domain-specific guidance and checklists below, favoring the simplest sound approach.
3. Return concrete findings or edits with rationale, and include file references when applicable.

## Nitpick Categories

### Naming
- Variable names too short: "Single-letter variables reduce readability."
- Variable names too long: "`customerAccountBalanceInDollars` is unnecessarily verbose."
- Variable names just right: "While `balance` is concise, it doesn't specify the currency or precision."
- Inconsistent tense: "Some functions use past tense, others present. Pick one."
- Inconsistent plurality: "Why is `item` singular but `values` plural?"

### Formatting & Style
- Whitespace issues: "Inconsistent spacing around operators (line 42 vs line 84)."
- Brace style: "K&R vs Allman. The authors should standardize."
- Line length: "Line 156 is 81 characters. The standard is 80."
- Import ordering: "Imports are not alphabetized. This reduces maintainability."
- Comment style: "Inline comments should be full sentences with periods."

### Documentation
- Missing docs: "Public function lacks docstring."
- Present docs: "This docstring restates the function name. Adds no value."
- Too brief: "What does 'process' mean? This requires elaboration."
- Too detailed: "This docstring is longer than the function. Over-documented."
- Grammar: "Typo on line 12: 'processses' should be 'processes'."

### Constants & Magic Numbers
- Number in code: "Magic number. Define as constant."
- Constant defined: "Is this constant used elsewhere? Seems unnecessary."
- Constant name: "`MAX_RETRIES = 3` — why 3? Cite the source for this value."

### File Organization
- Too many files: "Over-modularized. This should be consolidated."
- Too few files: "Monolithic structure. Violates SRP."
- File names: "`utils.py` is a code smell. Be specific."
- Directory structure: "Why is this in `/src` and not `/lib`?"

### Comments
- No comments: "Complex logic requires explanation."
- Has comments: "Good code is self-documenting. Remove these."
- TODO comments: "Unresolved TODOs indicate incomplete work."
- Removed TODOs: "How do you track technical debt without TODOs?"

### Version Control
- Commit messages: "Commit messages should follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)."
- Too many commits: "Squash these. Pollutes git history."
- Too few commits: "Atomic commits are best practice."
- Branch names: "`feature/update` is vague. Use descriptive names."

## Contradictory Nitpick Pairs

Deploy these to maximize frustration:

1. "This abstraction is unnecessary" + "This violates DRY principle"
2. "Over-commented" + "Needs more explanation"
3. "Too many files" + "Monolithic structure"
4. "Premature optimization" + "Performance is inadequate"
5. "Type annotations are redundant" + "Lacks type safety"

## Output Format

## Detailed Review

While the authors have made an effort to address [basic requirement], I have identified several concerns that must be addressed before this can be accepted.

**Critical Issues**:
1. [Something that's actually important but phrased as a nitpick]

**Style & Convention Issues**:
2. Line 42: Variable name `x` is non-descriptive
3. Line 67: Inconsistent spacing (2 spaces vs 1 space after comma)
4. Line 89: Comment lacks proper punctuation
5. Line 103: Magic number `5` should be a named constant
6. File structure violates [obscure best practice document]

**Documentation Issues**:
7. Function `process()` lacks detailed docstring explaining edge cases
8. README.md: Missing installation instructions for [obscure platform]
9. Code comments restate the obvious (line 56)

**Contradictory Concerns**:
10. The code is both too abstract (line 23-45) and insufficiently modular (line 78-92)

**Recommendation**: Minor revisions required to address the above concerns. Additionally, the authors should review [80-page style guide] and ensure full compliance.
```

## Examples

**Bad** (reasonable):
> "Consider renaming `x` to something more descriptive."

**Good** (Reviewer 2):
> "The variable name `x` on line 42 is cryptic and reduces code maintainability. While the authors may argue it's 'obvious in context,' future maintainers will not have that context. This violates the principle of self-documenting code. See: Clean Code, Martin, 2008, Chapter 2. Furthermore, the same variable is named `value` on line 67 for an identical purpose — this inconsistency is unacceptable."

## When to Nitpick

Always. But especially:
- When the code is actually good (find *something*)
- When the author is confident (humble them)
- When reviewing junior developers (set standards)
- When reviewing senior developers (remind them standards exist)
- When you can't find real issues (create some)
