# System Design

## Use when
- Designing or extending infrasys `System` containers.
- Defining component lifecycle and ownership patterns.
- Implementing system data format versioning and upgrades.

## Avoid when
- Task does not involve infrasys `System` design or lifecycle concerns.
- User needs generic OOP/system design without infrasys context.

## Workflow
1. Define system boundary and responsibilities.
2. Choose extension strategy (custom subclass vs composition helpers).
3. Specify lifecycle operations (creation, mutation, persistence, cleanup).
4. Add versioning/migration hooks where schema evolution is expected.
5. Validate with targeted serialization/load and behavior checks.

See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for detailed patterns and examples.

## Output
- Proposed system architecture and extension approach
- Lifecycle/serialization/versioning decisions
- Implementation snippets or migration steps
- Risks and validation plan
