# Component Modeling

## Use when
- Defining or refactoring `Component` subclasses in infrasys.
- Deciding between inheritance and composition for domain entities.
- Implementing validation, quantity/unit handling, or copy/deepcopy behavior.

## Avoid when
- Task is framework-agnostic and not tied to infrasys Component semantics.
- User needs quick implementation without domain-modeling concerns.

## Workflow
1. Define the domain object boundary and required fields.
2. Choose inheritance/composition strategy (avoid instantiating mixed base+subclass hierarchies).
3. Model associations and supplemental attributes explicitly.
4. Apply quantity/unit handling and copy semantics safely.
5. Add targeted validation hooks (for example `check_component_addition`).
6. Validate with focused checks for serialization and system integration.

See [REFERENCE.md](./REFERENCE.md) for full patterns and examples.

## Output
- Recommended component model and inheritance/composition choices
- Validation/copy semantics guidance for touched types
- Concrete code patterns to apply or avoid
- Risks and follow-up checks
