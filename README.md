# agents

A collection of AI agents built with [gitagent](https://github.com/open-gitagent/gitagent), plus **pi-gitagent**: a [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) extension that loads any gitagent agent into your session.

## Install

```bash
pi install https://github.com/pesap/agents
```

That's it. Now you have `/gitagent` in every pi session.

## Usage

```bash
# Load a local agent
/gitagent load code-reviewer

# Load from GitHub (shorthand)
/gitagent load gh:pesap/agents/code-reviewer

# Load from GitHub (full URL)
/gitagent load https://github.com/pesap/agents/tree/main/code-reviewer

# Load any gitagent repo
/gitagent load gh:shreyas-lyzr/architect

# Create a brand new agent from a prompt
/gitagent new "a code reviewer specialized in Rust unsafe blocks"

# List agents in a repo
/gitagent list gh:pesap/agents

# Show loaded agent info
/gitagent info

# Re-pull latest from remote
/gitagent refresh

# Remove agent context
/gitagent unload
```

Loaded agents persist across sessions in the same pi session file, so you don't need to reload after restarts.

### LLM-callable tools

The extension also registers tools that the LLM can call directly. When you say "load the simplify agent and review my code", the LLM calls `gitagent_load` with a `followUp` parameter so the review runs with the agent's context active.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gitagent_load` | Load an agent, optionally queue a follow-up task |
| `gitagent_unload` | Remove the loaded agent context |
| `gitagent_info` | Show the currently loaded agent |
| `gitagent_list` | List available agents in a directory or repo |
| `gitagent_remember` | Save a learning to the agent's persistent memory |

## Skill Usage Protocol and Verification Hooks

Agents with skills now get an explicit runtime protocol:

- Match the task against available skills before execution
- Apply the selected skill checklists while working
- Include a `Skills Used` section in the final response (or `none` with reason)

A lightweight hook audits assistant responses and records pass/fail skill checks in session entries (`gitagent-skill-check`). In strict mode, if a response is missing the section, pi queues an automatic follow-up reminder and logs `gitagent-skill-enforcement`.

## Automatic Feedback Memory Hook

Like a mini diary for user preferences, pi-gitagent can auto-capture feedback-looking user messages (preferences, corrections, praise with meta context) and save them into the active agent memory as dated `[feedback/<topic>/<sentiment>]` entries.

This hook is **opt-in per agent** (default off), configured in `agent.yaml` under `metadata.feedback_memory_hook`.

Each capture is logged as a session entry (`gitagent-feedback-captured`) with inferred signal and confidence, deduplicated per turn, and filtered by the configured confidence threshold.

```yaml
metadata:
  category: developer-tools
  feedback_memory_hook:
    enabled: true
    min_confidence: 0.9
    max_chars: 220
    redact_sensitive: true
```

When you load an agent, pi-gitagent:
1. Resolves the agent (local dir or GitHub clone, cached at `~/.pitagent/cache/`)
2. Parses `agent.yaml`, `SOUL.md`, `RULES.md`, skills, knowledge, memory
3. Injects the agent's full identity into the system prompt
4. Switches to the agent's preferred model
5. Shows a status indicator in the footer

## Creating New Agents

`/gitagent new <prompt>` temporarily loads the [gitagent architect](https://github.com/shreyas-lyzr/architect) into your session, sends your prompt, and lets it create a full agent (agent.yaml, SOUL.md, RULES.md, skills, etc.) in your working directory. Once the architect finishes, your previous agent is automatically restored.

```bash
/gitagent new "an agent that reviews SQL queries for performance and security"
```

## What Gets Loaded

| gitagent file | How it's used in pi |
|---------------|---------------------|
| `SOUL.md` | Appended to system prompt (identity, personality) |
| `RULES.md` | Appended to system prompt (hard constraints) |
| `PROMPT.md` | Appended to system prompt (operational instructions) |
| `DUTIES.md` | Appended to system prompt (segregation of duties) |
| `skills/` | Loaded into prompt with `When to use` + checklist instructions, plus response protocol (`Skills Used`) |
| `knowledge/` | `always_load` docs baked into system prompt |
| `memory/MEMORY.md` | Loaded into context, agent can write learnings back |
| `agent.yaml` model | Auto-switches pi to the preferred model |
| `agent.yaml` compliance | Translated to behavioral constraints |

## Memory and Learning

Agent memory is stored in a centralized location at `~/.pitagent/memory/<agent-name>/MEMORY.md`, separate from both local agent directories and the remote clone cache. This means:

- **Memory survives cache clears.** Running `/gitagent refresh` (which does `git reset --hard` on cached repos) won't nuke your learnings.
- **Same memory regardless of source.** Whether you load an agent locally or from GitHub, the agent reads and writes from the same memory file. No duplicated or lost state.
- **Safe from accidents.** Memory isn't sitting inside a shallow clone that can be wiped at any time.

The LLM saves learnings by calling the `gitagent_remember` tool, and feedback can also be captured automatically by hook (for agents with `feedback_memory_hook.enabled=true`) when user messages look like preferences/corrections. Entries are concise and dated. On session shutdown, if nothing was saved and the session was non-trivial (2+ user messages), a session note is auto-appended so no context is silently lost.

|-------|-------------|
| [code-reviewer](./code-reviewer) | Analyzes code for bugs, security issues, performance, and style |
| [performance-freak](./performance-freak) | Optimizes code for speed and memory efficiency |
| [simplify](./simplify) | Reviews code for reuse, quality, and efficiency |
| [github-ci-optimizer](./github-ci-optimizer) | Optimizes GitHub Actions CI |

## Try without installing

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/pesap/agents
```

Then use `/gitagent` as normal. The extension is loaded for that session only.

## Built with

- [gitagent](https://github.com/open-gitagent/gitagent) — git-native agent standard
